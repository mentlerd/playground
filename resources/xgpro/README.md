This folder contains resource files to be used with Xgpro, the Windows GUI application supplied with the T48 universal programmer.

The EEPROM chips I have appear to be new reruns, or forged copies of the SST 27SF512 chip, and fail the builtin ID check of the programmer.

They program just fine though, so I made this custom configuration with the unexpected/non-standard manufacturer ID.
